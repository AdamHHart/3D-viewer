This repo is a part of the "Build a web-based 3D viewer workshop" conducted as part of AECTech2021.  
The workshop walks participants through the process of building a web-based 3D model viewer for visualizing and sharing 3D models with their team. Starting from the ground up, the course will cover how to build a simple backend server serving a Vue based frontend hosted on firebase. From there, participants will learn how to set up a database with authentication allowing users to upload and store 3D models. Finally, the focus will shift to building out the frontend around a threejs based model viewer.
